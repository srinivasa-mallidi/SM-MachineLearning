### Case Study: Multi-Modal COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Chest X-rays and Patient Metadata

#### Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools. This case study explores the development of a multi-modal deep learning model that leverages both chest X-ray images and patient metadata to diagnose COVID-19. By combining image analysis with tabular data (e.g., patient age, sex), the model aims to improve diagnostic accuracy compared to using image data alone.

#### Dataset Explanation

The dataset used in this case study is sourced from the "https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/COVID-19_Chest_X-Ray_Image_Repository/12580328".. It contains a comprehensive collection of chest X-ray images along with metadata for each patient. The dataset structure is as follows:

-   **covid_cx_dataset**
    -   **metadata.csv**: Contains patient metadata and image labels.
    -   **covid19**: Directory containing the chest X-ray images.

The `metadata.csv` file includes the following columns:

-   `filename`: Name of the image file.
-   `patient_id`: Unique identifier for each patient.
-   `sex`: Sex of the patient.
-   `age`: Age of the patient.
-   `view`: The view of the X-ray image.
-   `label`: The diagnosis label (e.g., COVID-19).
-   `pcr_test`: Result of the PCR test.
-   Other columns provide additional clinical information.
