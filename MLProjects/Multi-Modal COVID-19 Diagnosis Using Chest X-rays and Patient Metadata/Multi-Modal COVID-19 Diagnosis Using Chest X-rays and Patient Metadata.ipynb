    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools. This case study explores the development of a multi-modal deep learning model that leverages both chest X-ray images and patient metadata to diagnose COVID-19. By combining image analysis with tabular data (e.g., patient age, sex), the model aims to improve diagnostic accuracy compared to using image data alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this case study is sourced from \"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/COVID-19_Chest_X-Ray_Image_Repository/12580328\". It contains a comprehensive collection of chest X-ray images along with metadata for each patient. The dataset structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **covid_cx_dataset**\n",
    "    -   **metadata.csv**: Contains patient metadata and image labels.\n",
    "    -   **covid19**: Directory containing the chest X-ray images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `metadata.csv` file includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `filename`: Name of the image file.\n",
    "-   `patient_id`: Unique identifier for each patient.\n",
    "-   `sex`: Sex of the patient.\n",
    "-   `age`: Age of the patient.\n",
    "-   `view`: The view of the X-ray image.\n",
    "-   `label`: The diagnosis label (e.g., COVID-19).\n",
    "-   `pcr_test`: Result of the PCR test.\n",
    "-   Other columns provide additional clinical information."
