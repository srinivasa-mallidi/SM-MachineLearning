    "\r\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions. Instead, these systems rely on patterns and inference derived from data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.\r\n",
