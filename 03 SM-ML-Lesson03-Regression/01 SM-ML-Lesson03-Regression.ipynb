    "\n",
    "### What is Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is a predictive modeling technique used to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It is widely used for forecasting and predicting numerical outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Linear Regression**: Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "-   **Non-linear Regression**: Models complex relationships that cannot be captured by linear models.\n",
    "-   **Polynomial Regression**: A type of non-linear regression where the relationship is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.\n",
    "-   **Regularized Regression**: Includes techniques like Ridge and Lasso that add regularization terms to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "-   **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems, despite its name suggesting a regression model."

    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   yyy is the dependent variable.\n",
    "-   xxx is the independent variable.\n",
    "-   β0 ​ is the intercept.\n",
    "-   β1 ​ is the slope.\n",
    "-   ϵ  is the error term.\n",

    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/multilinearregression.jpg\" alt=\"loaderror\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Linearity**: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.\n",
    "2.  **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3.  **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals (errors) have constant variance.\n",
    "4.  **Normality**: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute errors.\n",
    "-   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared errors.\n",
    "-   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE.\n",
    "-   **R-squared (R2R^2R2)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model."

    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial regression models the relationship as an nth degree polynomial. It is useful for capturing non-linear relationships.\n",

    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression adds a penalty equal to the sum of the squared coefficients to the loss function. This prevents overfitting by shrinking the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/L2Regularization.jpg\" alt=\"loaderror\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression adds a penalty equal to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This can lead to sparse models where some coefficients are exactly zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR uses the same principles as Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification but is adapted for regression. It tries to fit the best line within a threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree regression uses a tree-like model of decisions. It splits the data into branches to predict the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest regression is an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to predict the target value. The final prediction is an average of all tree predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosting Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting regression builds models sequentially, each trying to correct the errors of the previous model. It combines weak learners into a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression predicts the target value based on the average of the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian regression applies Bayesian principles to linear regression. It involves prior distributions for the model parameters and updates these priors with data to form posterior distributions.\n",
